This project is a simple clone of [Lwt](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lwt/)

What it doesn't support:
* Word splitting/joining.
* Word review
* Back up / restore (not yet)
* Custom language.
* Search, tags.

What it does better:
* Automated words splitting base on dictionary.
* Faster text loading speed.
* More detailed learning status of texts.
* Unlimit text length (You can import a whole book into just 1 text) without affect performance while reading.
* Intergrated dictionary api.
